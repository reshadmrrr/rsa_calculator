There are 3 apk files in this folder... 
1. app-arm64-v8a-release.apk: Install this file if your android device runs on an arm64 based system (in another way if your device has 64-bit arm processor). Nowadays, most new phones run on arm64 architecture processors. 
2. app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk: Install this if your android device runs on an armeabi system (which is basically 32-bit processor). Mostly, old phones runs on these arm 32-bit architecture processors.
3. app-x86_64-release.apk: Install this if your android device is a tab (or run on an intel/AMD system).

If you don't know anything about the processor you can google about your processor and get to know about architecture. Good Luck.
